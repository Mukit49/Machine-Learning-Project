                                                     Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset
                                                     
   The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images of 10 different classes like cars, birds, dogs, horses, ships, trucks, etc. The idea of the project is to build an image classification model that will be able to identify what class the input image belongs to. Image classification is used in many applications and it is a great project to start deep learning.  
   
Image classification is a fascinating deep learning project. Specifically, image classification comes under the computer vision project category.

In this project, we will build a convolution neural network in Keras with python on a CIFAR-10 dataset. First, we will explore our dataset, and then we will train our neural network using python and Keras.

CIFAR-10 is a very popular computer vision dataset. This dataset is well studied in many types of deep learning research for object recognition.

This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images of shape 32*32. This dataset contains images of low resolution (32*32), which allows researchers to try new algorithms. The 10 different classes of this dataset are:


1.Airplane
2.Car
3.Bird
4.Cat
5.Deer
6.Dog
7.Frog
8.Horse
9.Ship
10.Truck
